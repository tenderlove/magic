Pow/Tgh:	n/a
Card Text:	Players must leave game in progress as it is and use the cards
		left in their libraries as decks with which to play a subgame
		of Magic. When subgame is over, players shuffle these cards,
		return them to libraries, and resume game in progress, with
		any loser of subgame halving his or her remaining life points,
		rounding down. Effects that prevent damage may not be used
		to counter this loss of life. The subgame has no ante; using less
		than forty cards may be necessary.
